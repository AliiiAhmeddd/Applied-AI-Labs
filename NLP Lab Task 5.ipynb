    "\n",
    "TextBlob is a rule-based, dictionary-driven sentiment analyzer.\n",
    "It struggles with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mixed or contrasting sentiment\n",
    "The sentence contains both praise and criticism. TextBlob does not understand structure, so it averages them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context and nuance\n",
    "It cannot understand that the negative part is more impactful than the positive part.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intensity differences\n",
    "Words like \"frustrating\" may not be weighted strongly enough.\n",

    "Which method is best for complex reviews?\n",
    "1. TextBlob\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very easy to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good for simple sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poor with nuance, mixed opinions, or long reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "2. AFINN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slightly better weighting of negative words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Still dictionary-based, no understanding of context\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can't handle long or complex sentences well\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression (Machine Learning Model) — BEST CHOICE\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns patterns from data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles more complex expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understands weighting based on real examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performs better on reviews, nuanced language, multi-sentence inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires labelled training data\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression (with TF-IDF features) is the best method among the three for analyzing long, complex reviews because:\n",
    "\n",
    "It learns from real examples\n",
    "\n",
    "It better captures patterns of negative vs positive sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is less sensitive to ambiguous or mixed language\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs better on multi-clause, nuanced opinions"
